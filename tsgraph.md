# &#128018;&#128018; Time Series and R Graphics &#128018;&#128018;


This is a resurrection of the _Time Series and Graphics_ page that had been discontinued.  

For this page, we'll use Vanilla R, [astsa](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa), and [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2). We used to include demonstrations from the `ggfortify` package, but it was changed so often that eventually most of the examples didn't work. There are some examples at the end.

You'll need two packages to reproduce the examples. All the data used in the examples are from [astsa](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa).
```r
install.packages(c("astsa", "ggplot2"))
```
<br/>


&#x1F4A1; You may also want to check out the [Cairo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Cairo) package to create high-quality graphics.  It's not necessary, but it sure looks nice. The package is built into R, but needs to be loaded (don't we all?) `library(Cairo)`.

### Part 1 - simple but effective
---

&#128526; First, here's how to plot `gtemp_land` using the base graphics. If you add a grid after you plot, it goes on top. You have some work to do if you want the grid underneath... but at least you can work around that - read on.

```r
# for a basic plot, all you need is
plot(gtemp_land)                    # it can't get simpler than that (not shown)

plot(gtemp_land, type='o', col=4)   # a slightly nicer version  
```

![](figs/basetemp0.png)

```r                                              
# but here's a pretty version using Vanilla R that includes a grid  
par(mar=c(2,2,.5,.5)+.5, mgp=c(1.6,.6,0))                   # trim the margins       
plot(gtemp_land, ylab='Temperature Deviations', type='n')    # set up the plot
grid(lty=1, col=gray(.9))                                  # add a grid
lines(gtemp_land, type='o', col=4)                         # and now plot the line
```

![](figs/basetemp.png)


 ðŸ‘» In the above, we used `plot`, which works for time series. If the data aren't time series,
 you can use `plot.ts` instead...  but either way, `plot.ts` works for both, so maybe it's just better to use that for Vanilla R.

<br/>

But you can get all that and more with [astsa](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa).

```r 
# in astsa, it's a one liner
tsplot(gtemp_land, type='o', col=4, ylab='Temperature Deviations')
```

![](figs/gtemp.png)

&#128227; `tsplot` was written because we did many demonstrations (mainly in class) and as you can see from the first plot, Vanilla R graphics is ugly without additional fixings.  And,  we didn't want to type a hundred lines of code while trying to talk about the data (the students would have revolted by the time we got it all out).


<br/>

&#x1F535; And a `ggplot2` of the gtemp series. `ggplot2` doesn't play with time series so you have to create a data frame that strips the series to its bare naked data.

```r
gtemp.df = data.frame(Time=c(time(gtemp_land)), gtemp=c(gtemp_land)) # strip the ts attributes
ptemp    = ggplot(data = gtemp.df,  aes(x=Time, y=gtemp) )   +   # store it
                  ylab('Temperature Deviations')             +
                  geom_line(col="blue")                      +
                  geom_point(col="blue", pch=1)
ptemp                                                            # plot it    

# To remove the gray background, run 
ptemp + theme_bw()       # not shown  
```

![](figs/gtemp2.png)

It's not necessary to store the figure... it's just an example of what you can do.

&#128520; If you like the gray background with white grid lines, you can do a gris-gris plot with `astsa` (the grammar of `astsa` is &#119985;&#119978;&#119978;&#119967;&#119978;&#119978;Â &#128128;)

```r
tsplot(gtemp_land, gg=TRUE, type='o', pch=20, col=4, ylab='Temperature Deviations')
```

![](figs/gtemp3.png)

### Part 2 - two series
---

&#128125; Time to get a little more complex by plotting two series that touch each other (but in a nice way) on the same plot.  We'll get to the general stuff soon.

&#x1F535; Here's an example of `ggplot` for two time series, one at a time (not the best way for many time series).

```r
gtemp.df    = data.frame(Time=c(time(gtemp_land)), gtemp=c(gtemp_land), gtemp2=c(gtemp_ocean))
ggplot(data = gtemp.df, aes(x=Time, y=value, color=variable )  )             +
              ylab('Temperature Deviations')                                 +
              geom_line(aes(y=gtemp , col='Land Only'),  size=1, alpha=.5)   +
              geom_line(aes(y=gtemp2, col='Ocean Only'), size=1, alpha=.5)   +
              theme(legend.position=c(.1,.85))			  
```

![](figs/gtemp4.png)<br/>
'Land Only' and 'Ocean Only' have since become my favorite colors.

<br/>

&#x1F535;  Now the same idea using `tsplot` from `astsa` with the `spaghetti` option. There are more examples at [FUN WITH ASTSA](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/fun_with_astsa/fun_with_astsa.md), where the fun never stops.

```r
tsplot(cbind(gtemp_land,gtemp_ocean), col=astsa.col(c(2,5),.5), lwd=2, gg=TRUE,
          ylab='Temperature Deviations', spaghetti=TRUE)
legend("topleft", legend=c("Land Only","Ocean Only"), col=c(2,5), lty=1, bty="n")
```

![](figs/gtemp5.png)

<br/>

ðŸ’– Coming in `astsa` version 2.2 (and beyond), there is an `addLegend` option in `tsplot`, por exemplo:

```r
tsplot(cbind(Mortality=cmort, Pollution=part), col=5:6, gg=TRUE, spaghetti=TRUE, addLegend=TRUE)
```

![](figs/addLegend.png)

... that's it at its most basic - there are more `addLegend` options (you can always get the updated package from [astsa NEWS](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) ).

<br/>

&#127760;  There may be an occasion when you want the legend on the outer margin. This is one way to do it.  The data are sleep states and number of movements.  

```r
# depending on the dimension of the plot, you may 
#  have to adjust the right margin (9) up or down 
#  and/or adjust the inset (-.3)
par(xpd = NA, oma=c(0,0,0,9) )  
tsplot(sleep2[[3]][2:3], type='s', col=astsa.col(2:3,.7), spag=TRUE, gg=TRUE)
legend('topright', inset=c(-.3,0), bty='n', lty=1, col=2:3, legend=c('sleep state',
        'number of \nmovements'))
```

![](figs/tsleep.png)

<br/>

Here's another way to do it that may be more precise:

```R
par(oma=c(0,0,0,5))
tsplot(cbind(Hare,Lynx), col=astsa.col(c(2,4),.5), lwd=2, type="o", pch=c(0,2), spaghetti=TRUE, ylab='Number', gg=TRUE)
mtext('(\u00D71000)', side=2, adj=1, line=1.5, cex=.8)  # we'll talk about this later
# then put the legend right where you want it
legend(x=1940, y=150, col=c(2,4), lty=1, legend=c("Hare", "Lynx"), pch=c(0,2), bty="n", xpd=NA) 
```

![](figs/HL.png)

<br/>



&#x1F535;  You'll see how to do this with `ggplot` below.  In the global temperature example above, just leave off the last line:

```r
gtemp.df    = data.frame(Time=c(time(gtemp_land)), gtemp=c(gtemp_land), gtemp2=c(gtemp_ocean))
ggplot(data = gtemp.df, aes(x=Time, y=value, color=variable )  )             +
              ylab('Temperature Deviations')                                 +
              geom_line(aes(y=gtemp , col='Land Only'),  size=1, alpha=.5)   +
              geom_line(aes(y=gtemp2, col='Ocean Only'), size=1, alpha=.5)   
              # theme(legend.position=c(.1,.85))	
```

Here's the `ggplot` code for the sleep data - the first two lines are used because `ggplot` wants the data one way only... it's a recurring theme.

```r
library(reshape)                         # install 'reshape' if you don't have it
df     = melt(sleep2[[3]][,2:3])         # reshape the data frame
minute = rep(1:120, 2)
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=minute, y=value, col=variable)) +
        geom_step(lwd=1, alpha=.7)                    +
        ylab('')                                      + 
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,120,by=30))  
# The last line was used to get more meaningful ticks on the time axis.
```

### Part 3 - many series
---

&#x1F535; Let's start with `ggplot2`. We're going to plot the 8 explosion series.

```r
library(reshape)            # install 'reshape' if you don't have it
df   = melt(eqexp[,9:16])   # reshape the data frame
Time = rep(1:2048, 8)
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Time, y=value, col=variable))   +
     geom_line( )                                     +
     theme(legend.position="none")                    +
     facet_wrap(~variable, ncol=2, scales='free_y')   +
     ylab('')	
```

![](figs/ggexp.png)

<br/>

&#129299; Now let's try the same thing with `tsplot`.  We're going to use the new `astsa.col` color wheel option and we'll make it a gris-gris plot.  You don't have to melt anything.  

```r
tsplot(eqexp[,9:16], col=astsa.col(4, wheel=TRUE, num=8), ncol=2, gg=TRUE, scale=.8)
```

![](figs/tsexp.png)

`scale` controls the size of the axis labels. 

<br/>

&#x1F535; Here it is using basic Vanilla R graphics.

```r
plot.ts(eqexp[,9:16], main='')
```

![](figs/baseexp.png)

<br/>


&#128530; Let's do another `ggplot` with more than 2 series on the same plot. The script does not work with time series so you have to spend some time removing the time series attributes.  You could try `ggfortify`, but we'll hold off until the end for that.

&#128549;  We're going to use 3 series from the LA Pollution study from `astsa`.  The data are weekly time series, so we're removing the attributes first.

```r
mortality    = c(cmort)  # cardiovascular mortality
temperature  = c(tempr)  # termperature
pollution    = c(part)   # particulate pollution
df   = melt(data.frame(mortality, temperature, pollution))
Time = c(time(cmort), time(tempr), time(part))
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Time, y=value, col=variable)) +
    geom_line( )                                    +
    ylab("LA Pollution Study")
```

![](figs/gglap.png)

<br/>

&#128527;  This is how we would do it using `tsplot` ðŸ’– using the new version 2.3 `addLegend` option:

```r
tsplot(cbind(cmort,tempr,part), ylab='LA Pollution Study', col=astsa.col(2:4,.8), spag=TRUE, gg=TRUE,
        addLegend=TRUE, legend=c('Mortality', 'Temperature', 'Pollution'), llwd=2)
```

![](figs/addLegend2.png)

<br/>

And in Vanilla R graphics:

```r
ts.plot(cbind(cmort,tempr,part), main='LA Pollution Study', col=2:4)
legend('topright', legend=c('Mortality', 'Temperature', 'Pollution'), 
          lty=1, lwd=2, col=2:4, bg='white')
```

 ![](figs/baselap.png)

### Part 4 - missing data
---

&#128518; In base graphics, it is sooooooo simple and the result is decent. The data set `blood` is a multiple time series data set with lots of `NA`s.  You need to have points (`type='o'` here) to get the stuff that can't be connected with lines.

```r
# if you leave off the cex=1, the points are too small
plot(blood, type='o', pch=19, main='', cex=1, yax.flip=TRUE)
```

Again, if `blood` weren't a time series, you would use `plot.ts` instead of `plot`... BUT you wouldn't use `ts.plot` here because that would be a mess - try it and see what happens (not responsible for injuries).


![](figs/baseblood.png)

<br/>

&#128525; Here it is using `astsa`:

```r
tsplot(blood, type='o', col=c(4,6,3), pch=19, cex=1, gg=TRUE)  
```

![](figs/tsblood.png)

&#127881; &#127880; Nothing to it! &#127880; &#127881;

<br/>

![](figs/slaphead.gif) So, here it is with `ggplot2`. It works ok, but you get warnings and other frustrations you'll see along the way...

```r
# make a data frame removing the time series attributes
df = data.frame(day=c(time(blood)), blood=c(blood), Type=factor(rep(c('WBC','PLT','HTC'), each=91)) )

# notice that the factor levels of Type are in alphabetical order...
levels(df$Type)           
   [1] "HTC" "PLT" "WBC"

# ... if I don't use the next line, the plot will be in alphabetical order ... 
# ... if I wanted the series in alphabetical order ...
# ... I would have ordered it that way - so I need ...
# ... the next line to reorder them back to the way I entered the data   ...
df$Type = factor(df$Type, levels(df$Type)[3:1])  
 
# any resemblance to the blood work of actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=day, y=blood, col=Type))       +
       ylab("Mary  Jane's  Blood  Work")             +   
       geom_line()                                   +
       geom_point()                                  +
       theme(legend.position="none")                 +
       facet_wrap(~Type, ncol=1, scales='free_y')
   
# Danger, Will Robinson! Warning! Warning! NAs appearing! 	   
 Warning messages:
 1: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_path).      
 2: Removed 111 rows containing missing values (geom_point).  
# We're doomed! Crepes suzette! 
```

![](figs/ggblood.png)

&#128262;&#128262;&#128262;&#128262;&#128262;

We're not done.  At least we got the plot after some work and warnings. But notice that the vertical axes have to have a common name.  If you want individual labels (e.g., WBC is measured in _cells/&mu;L_) then you're in a load of &#128169;&#128169;&#128169;  ... we guess that's not in the grammar of graphics too.). Anyway, we found this a long time ago if you want to force the matter: [how to plot differently scaled multiple time series with ggplot2](https://gist.github.com/tomhopper/faa24797bb44addeba79)... like this is rare???? &#128580;&#128580;&#128580;

Ok - let's redo it with `tsplot` with different y-labels and, if you dare, try this with &#128118; ggplot too &#128118; (if you use the link above, we won't consider it as cheating).

```r
# need astsa version 2.4 or higher to get 'title' and 'xlab' correct 
tsplot(blood, type='o', col=c(4,6,3), pch=19, scale=.95, gg=TRUE,
       title = colnames(blood),  xlab  = c(NA, NA,'day'), las=1,
       ylab  = c( 'log(cells/\u03BCL)', 'log(\u03BCL)', '% red blood cells' ))
```

### Part 5 - everything else
---

### xts and zoo

&#128047; First, some important packages for time series in R are  [xts]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xts) and [zoo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo).  Installing `xts` is enough to get both.

```r
install.packages('xts')  # if you don't have it already
library(xts)             # load it
#
plot(djia$Close, col=4)  # 'djia' is an 'xts' data file in 'astsa' 

```


![](figs/xts.png)

<br/>

#### pollution, weather, and mortality

Now we'll take the daily data from the LA Pollution Study: `lap.xts` (in `astsa`), take weekly averages and then plot those.

```R
library(xts)

# get weekly averages from daily data 
lapw = apply.weekly(lap.xts, FUN=colMeans)  

plot(lapw[,c('Cmort', 'Temp', 'Part')], col=astsa.col(2:4, .7), main=NA) 
addLegend(col=2:4, lty=1, lwd=2, ncol=3, bty="white")
```

![](figs/lap.png)

<br/>


#### you go girl 

It's fun to compare google searches... here's one for some female celebs taken from [Google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US), weekly number of searches for 5 years.  The downloaded data come in a `.csv` file with dates in the first column and looks something like this:

```r
Week,Taylor_Swift,Kim_Kardashian,Britney_Spears
12/31/2017,11,11,14
1/7/2018,10,12,3
1/14/2018,9,32,3
1/21/2018,7,19,5
...
```

This is where `xts` and `zoo` can make your life easier.  

```r
library(xts)  # loads both xts and zoo
x = read.zoo("google.csv", header=TRUE, sep=',', format = "%m/%d/%Y")
plot(as.xts(x), col=astsa.col(2:4,.7), main='Weekly Google Searches USA')
addLegend("topleft", col=2:4, lty=1, lwd=2, bg=gray(1), bty='o', box.col=gray(1)) 
```

![](figs/google.png)

<br/>

&#128047; In case `xts` is not available, you can use `timex` from `astsa` to plot `xts` data files.  For example, `djia` is an `xts` data file. But if you  plot the data without `xts` being loaded, you lose the dates on the time axis:

```r
tsplot(djia, ncol=2, col=2:7)   # no dates
```
![](figs/timex1.png)

Instead, you can do this:
```r
tsplot(timex(djia), djia, ncol=2, col=2:7)  # dates
```
![](figs/timex2.png)

<br/><br/>


#### ggfortify

&#x1F535; We should probably give [ggfortify](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggfotify) a little space, BUT there are NO guarantees that what you see here will work in the future.  These data are from `lap` , which is different from `lap.xts`.  The help file `?lap.xts` has the info.

```r
install.packages('ggfortify')  # if you don't have it already
library(ggfortify)             # load it

# all on same plot  
autoplot(cbind(Mortality=cmort, Temperature=tempr, Particulates=part), 
           xlab='Time', facets=FALSE, main='LA Pollution')  

# different plots 
autoplot(cbind(Mortality=cmort, Temperature=tempr, Particulates=part), 
            xlab='Time', ylab='LA Pollution', ts.colour = 4)  
```

![](figs/ggflap2.png)

![](figs/slaphead.gif) AGAIN, note that the order of the series is **alphabetical** and **NOT in the input order**. 

![](figs/ggflap3.png)

<br/>

To do the google search example above with `ggplot` try this (not shown)
```r
library(ggfortify) 
autoplot(as.xts(x), facets=FALSE)
```
but it's in alphabetical order, so Taylor is last when she should be first! 

<br/>



#### ribbon plot

&#129414; But here's something in the grammar of graphics too (`ggplot2`) ... a pretty _ribbon_ plot of the Southern Oscillation Index:

```r
cblue = astsa.col(5, .5)  # a little pastel
cred  = astsa.col(6, .5)  # is always refreshing
#
df    = data.frame(Time=c(time(soi)), SOI=c(soi), d=ifelse(c(soi)<0,0,1))
#
ggplot( data=df, aes(x=Time, y=SOI) )                              + 
 geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=d*SOI, ymin=0,  fill = "cool"))              +
 geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=0,  ymin=(1-d)*SOI, fill = "warm"))          +
 scale_fill_manual(name='SST', values=c("cool"=cblue,"warm"=cred)) +
 theme(legend.position=c(.05,.12)) 
```

![](figs/ggribsoi.png)

Well that might be pretty, but it obscures the trend, don't you think?

<br/>

#### trend

&#128056; If you really want to capture trend, try `trend` from `astsa`.
We're using various options here, a `lowess` fit and a gris-gris plot.


```r
trend(soi, lowess=TRUE, ylab="Southern Oscillation Index",  gg=TRUE)
```

![](figs/tssoi.png)

<br/>

ðŸ“ˆ To see the detrended series, use `detrend` from `astsa`

```r
tsplot(detrend(soi, lowess=TRUE), col=4, ylab="Detrended SOI", gg=TRUE)
```

![](figs/tsdetrendsoi.png)

<br/>

&#127871; And now with `ggplot` (remember to strip the attributes):

```r
df = data.frame(Time=c(time(soi)), SOI=c(soi))  	
ggplot( data=df, aes(x=Time, y=SOI) )        +
        geom_line(col=4)                     +
        geom_smooth(col=6)    
```

#### steps

&#129408; Here's a discrete-valued series plotted as a step function. `EQcount` in `astsa` is a count of certain types of earthquakes.

```r
tsplot(EQcount, col=4, type='s')
points(EQcount, pch=21, col=4, bg=6)   # just for kicks, not needed and better without it
```

A `type='h'` instead of `type='s'` looks good too.

#### size matters

&#127797; If you did not know this already , with time series, the dimensions of the plot matters.


&#128696; By default, R graphic devices are square (7 by 7 inches), which is generally bad for plotting time series as you will see. And, it's actually bad practice in general.  Edward Tufte, the expert on data visualization recommended using a golden rectangle in landscape orientation for most graphics. The _golden rectangle_ is a rectangle with a side ratio of approximately 1:1.618. If a graph suggests a shape on its own, follow that shape. If the graph doesn't suggest a shape, use a rectangular shape with one side 50% longer than the other. 

Apparently, you learn this in the 6th or 7th grade.  If you didn't, [check this out](https://legacyweb.philamuseum.org/doc_downloads/education/lessonPlans/Art%20and%20the%20Golden%20Rectangle.pdf).

In general, square graphs are for squares. I use an `.Rprofile` file in the working directory that takes care of this so I don't have to fix this with every plot:

```r
# graphic windows are 9 by 6 inches by default (it's not quite golden, but I like it)
grDevices::windows.options(width = 9, height = 6) 

# allows a quick use of Cairo - just cw() before a plot
cw = function(w=9, h=6){Cairo::CairoWin(width = w, height = h)}  
```

This consideration DOES NOT apply if you use RStudio.  If you do use RStudio, you are &#128169;&#128169;&#128169; out of luck because it's hip to be square in the studio.

&#129300; Here's the sunspot series from `astsa` using 2 different window sizes.   In the first plot, you see that the series rises quickly &uarr; and falls slowly &#8600; .  The second (square) plot obscures this fact.

```r
tsplot(sunspotz, type='o', pch=20, col=4)
```

### size really does matter

This is for base R... `ggplot` has similar problems but we'll let others take care of that.  When you do multifigure plots, the character expansion (`cex`) factor can get very small.  For example

```R
> par('cex')
  [1] 1
> par(mfrow=2:1)
> par('cex')
  [1] 1
> par(mfrow=c(3,1))
> par('cex')
  [1] 0.66   <-- this is ok on a screen, but too small for publication
```

Here's an example

```R
par(mfrow=c(3,1)) 
acf1(soi, 48, col=4, main="Southern Oscillation Index") 
acf1(rec, 48, col=4, main="Recruitment") 
ccf2(soi, rec, 48, col=4, main="SOI vs Recruitment")
```

![](figs/cex1.png)


```R
par(mfrow=c(3,1), cex=.9) 
acf1(soi, 48, col=4, main="Southern Oscillation Index") 
acf1(rec, 48, col=4, main="Recruitment") 
ccf2(soi, rec, 48, col=4, main="SOI vs Recruitment")
```

![](figs/cex2.png)


The interiors of the plots are similar, but the text in the first one is too small.  

In `astsa` version 2.2, we added a `scale` component to `tsplot` to help with the problem... compare these if you have version 2.2 or higher:

```R
tsplot(cbind(big=rnorm(100),bad=rnorm(100), john=rnorm(100)), scale=.75)  # match base R
tsplot(cbind(big=rnorm(100),bad=rnorm(100), john=rnorm(100)))             # default scale 1
tsplot(cbind(big=rnorm(100),bad=rnorm(100), john=rnorm(100)), scale=1.5)  # and way too big
```

The `scale` factor doesn't work for one-at-a-time plotting, so use the first method; e.g., this works with any version of `astsa`:

```R
par(mfrow=c(3,1))          # too small 
tsplot(cmort); tsplot(tempr); tsplot(part)

par(mfrow=c(3,1), cex=.9)  # so fix it 
tsplot(cmort); tsplot(tempr); tsplot(part)
```

<br/>

#### large values on the axis

&#9917; Dealing with large values on the vertical axis can be a bit of a pain because R graphics and consequently other packages (that I know of) don't do anything about it. Let's generate data that take on large values:

```r
x = ts(rnorm(100, 1000000, 10000), start=3000)
```

Now we'll try various plots-

```r
# xts
library(xts)
plot(as.xts(x), col=4)
```

![](figs/large_y2.png)


```r
# ggplot
df = data.frame(Time=c(time(x)), X=c(x))
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Time, y=X) ) + geom_line(col=4)    
```

![](figs/large_y3.png)

<br/>


&#128053; Our suggestion is to do something like the following...

```r
# tsplot with a trick - in the expression ""%*% is a cross and ~ is a space
tsplot(x/10^5, col=4, gg=TRUE, ylab=expression(X~~~~(""%*% 100000)))

# this unicode character also works
tsplot(x/10^5, col=4, gg=TRUE, ylab=(X~~~~('\u00D7 100000')))
```

![](figs/large_y4.png)

<br/>

If you want to move the (x 100000) to the edge, you can do something like this

```r
tsplot(x/10^5, col=4, gg=TRUE, ylab='X', las=0)
mtext(expression('\u00D7'~10^5), side=2, adj=1, line=1.5, cex=.9)
```

![](figs/large_y4b.png)



<br/>

That kind of  trick works with `ggplot` and `xts`, for example (not shown)
```r
# ggplot
df = data.frame(Time=c(time(x)), X=c(x))
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Time, y=X/100000) ) + geom_line(col=4) +
 ylab(X~~~~('\u00D7 100000'))

# xts 
plot(as.xts(x/100000), col=4, main='', ylab=expression(X~~~('\u00D7 100000') )) 
```

I like [this site](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/unicode-characters.html)  for a list of unicode characters because it is well laid out and lists the various versions of the characters.  For R, use the _escape_ version.

#### bring back the 60s

&#127812; And finally, a psychedelic base graphics plot of the sunspot numbers: &#127812;

```r
x      = sunspotz
culer1 = rgb(242, 153, 216, max=255)
culer2 = rgb(208,  73, 242, max=255)
culer3 = rgb( 77, 161, 249, max=255)
culer4 = rgb(  0, 200, 225, max=255)
culer5 = rgb(124, 231, 251, max=255)

par(mar=c(2,2,1,1)+2, mgp=c(3,.2,0), las=1, cex.main=2, tcl=0, col.axis=culer1, bg=rgb(.25,.1,.25))
plot(x, type='n', main='', ylab='', xlab='')
rect(par("usr")[1], par("usr")[3], par("usr")[2], par("usr")[4], col='black')
grid(lty=1, col=rgb(1,0,1, alpha=.5))
lines(x,                     lwd=3, col=culer1)
lines(window(x, start=1800), lwd=3, col=culer2)

lines(window(x, start=1900), lwd=3, col=culer4)
lines(window(x, start=1950), lwd=3, col=culer5)
title(expression('Psychedelic' * phantom(' Sunspots')), col.main=culer1) 
title(expression(phantom('Psychedelic') * ' Sunspots'), col.main=culer5) 
mtext('Time', side=1, line=2, col=culer3, font=2, cex=1.25)
mtext('Sunspot Numbers', side=2, line=2, col=culer2, font=2, las=0, cex=1.25)
text(1800, 180, "don't stare at the sunspots", col=culer5, srt=20, font=4)
text(1900, 170, "s.t.a.y  c.o.o.l", col=culer1, srt=330, font=4)
text(1850, 160, "dave? dave? \n dave's not here!", col=culer3, font=4)
```
